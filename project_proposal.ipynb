        "During the past decade, an increasing number of population is now living inside Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), a high-risk zone of wildfire. Such trend is the most prominent in California amid the housing crisis caused by a significant increase of population and a shrinking availability of homes. As a result, real estate companies started to develop in suburbs closer to the wild that  historically possesse a population density, which is referred to as **Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)**. \n",
        "\n",
        "The sprawling into the wild caused by such trend now puts more people at a greater exposure of high wildfire risk. Under a projected increase of wildfire occurrence caused by climate change, these people will eventually face even greater wildfire risk than present. A recent [New York Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/09/climate/growing-wildfire-risk-homes.html) visualized the sprawling into the WUI.\n",
